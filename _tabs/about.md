Hey there,

I am **Zeeshan Khan**, an iOS engineer at [Careem](https://www.careem.com) an Uber company.
This is my personal blog where I'm writing mainly to share my experience and learnings from iOS development.


This site also includes my notes which I usually prefer to have a look to recall things I've been reading. This might not be in a form of dedicated blog post or contain any explaination rather just few bullet points on a particular topic. Hope you find it useful. Thanks.
