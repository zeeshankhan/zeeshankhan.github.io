[Here](https://izeeshan.wordpress.com) you can find my very old blog posts mostly written for iOS and Objective-C language. I do not update this blog anymore. All new content will be recorded here.

### Here are some post from that blog

- [Core Data Migration](https://izeeshan.wordpress.com/2014/11/10/core-data-migration/)
- [Queue in Swift](https://izeeshan.wordpress.com/2016/03/05/queue-in-swift/)

Please reach out to me, if there's anything.

Thanks for the read, see you in next article :)
