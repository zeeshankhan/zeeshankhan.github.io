## [SE-2096][SE-0296] async, await

These are the two new keywords in Swift 5.5 for `func`s mostly to make them asynchronous and use it like a synchronous function.
`async` and `await` is to help us avoid pyramid of doom by avoiding completion handler. 

Ex:
```swift
func foo() async -> Int { 0 }

await foo()
```

When function throws

Ex:
```swift
func foo() async throws -> Int { 0 }

try await foo()
```

- Synchronous functions can not call asynchronous functions directly, they must use await keyword.
- async functions can call async functions
- We can have two functions with same name and only differs with `async` keyword, Compiler decides at runtime based on context.

## [SE-2098][SE-0298] async sequence

`AsyncSequence` and `AsyncIteratorProtocol` are new adding for concurrency for looping over asynchronous sequence of values.

Ex:
```swift
struct MyArray: AsyncSequence {
    struct MyIterator: AsyncIteratorProtocol {
        func next() async -> Int { 0 }
    }
}

for await item in myArray {}
```

## [SE-0310][SE-0310] async readonly properties

Ex:
```swift
struct User {
    var name: String {
        get async throws {
            try String(contentOf: ... )
        }
    }
}

try await User().name
```

## [SE-0304][SE-0304] Structured concurrency

`Task` and `TaskGroup` allows us to run concurrent operations with a range of functions like `execute`, `cancel`, `monitor` etc.

Ex:
```swift
let myTask = Task { 
    //...
}

let result = await myTask.value
```

- `myTask` will start running on background thread immediately
- Task starts running as soon as it is created.
- Task has priorities like `high`, `low`, `default` and `background`.
  - `userInitiated` ~> `high`
  - `utility` ~> `low`
  - `userInteractive` ~> only for main thread
- Task can `sleep`, `cancel`, `checkCancel` and also
- `yield()` which suspends the current task for few moments in order to give sometime to any other task that might be waiting.

## [SE-0317][SE-0317] async let binding

Ex:
```swift
func calculateAge() async -> Int { 0 }

async let age = calculateAge()
```

- we can only use `async let` if we are already in a async context.
- `try` is not required for throwing functions `try async let` is not valid. It can automatically be pushed where we await result.
```swift
    func foo() async throws {}
    async let x = foo()
    try await x
```

## [SE-0300][SE-0300] Continuations

1. `withCheckedContinuation` swift performs runtime check to warn us about the `resume` call.
2. `withUnsafeContinuation` swift does not performs any check
3. `resume` function must be called ONLY once.

Ex:
```swift
func fetchData(_ completion: @escaping ([Int]) -> Void) {}
func fetch() async -> [Int] {
    await withCheckedContinuation { cont in //1
        fetchData { array in
            cont.resume(returning: array) //3
        }
    }
}
```

## [SE-0306][SE-0306] Actors

- Actors are like classes which are safe to use in concurrent environment.
- Swift ensures that mutable state inside Actor are always accessed by one threat at any given time.
- Actors are like atomic classes.
- `actor` is the new type just like `class`, `struct` and `enum`.
- They can have methods, properties, initializers, subscripts and static properties. It can confirm to protocols and be generic.
- Actors can use its own properties and functions freely but if it is using another actor inside then it can be used only asynchronously.
- `actor` is a reference type just like a `class`.
- Actors do not support inheritance, so No `overriding`, No `final`, No super calls.
- All actors implicitly confirms to new Actor protocol.

Ex:
```swift
actor Foo {
    func jump() async {}
}
```

## [SE-0316][SE-0316] Global Actors

`@MainActor` An attribute to mark properties and methods that should be used only on main thread. So we don't need to check for `Thread.isMainThread` anymore. 
- Functions marked with `@MainActor` can only be used via `await` or `async let`

Ex:
```swift
class Foo {
    @MainActor
    func jump() {}
}

await Foo().jump()
```

## [SE-0302][SE-0302] Sendable and its closure

`Sendable` protocol and `@sendable` closure attribute.
```swift
func foo(_ completion: @escaping @sendable () -> Void) {}
```
- Sendable data can be safely transferred to another thread.
- All value types (`Bool`, `String`, `Int`, etc) confirms to `Sendable` protocol.
- Optional with value type, Dictionary with value type and Tuples confirms as well.
- Actors also confirm to Sendable because they handle their synchronization internally.
- Custom `struct` or `enum` also confirms if they only have value types or type that already confirm to Sendable.
- Same with `class` if they inherit from `NSObject` and they are marked `final`.


## [SE-0308][SE-0308] Postfix member expression
Mostly used in swift UI
Ex:
```swift
#if OS(iOS)
// ...
#else
//...
#endif

#if DEBUG
#endif
```

## [SE-0307][SE-0307] Interchangeable double and CGFloat
No more conversion required
Ex:
```swift
let value = Double(3) + CGFloat(4)
```

## [SE-2095][SE-0295] Codable for enum with associated values

Ex:
```swift
enum Foo: Codable {
    case dance(Int)
}
```

## lazy in local context

Ex:
```swift
func jump() {
    lazy var name = ""
}
```

## [SE-2093][SE-0293] Extended property wrapper for functions and closures

## [SE-2099][SE-0299] Extended static member lookup in generic context
